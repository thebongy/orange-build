Build a game where I see a map with circles on cities. Each city is a cloudflare datacenter. The map shows with data centres highlighted for 20 seconds, and after that, we show grayed out circles in multiple regions. The user's goal is to remember and click as many regions as they can in 20 seconds and get points based on that

Create a file manager dashboard with a sidebar for navigation, a main area for file display, 
a toolbar for actions. The sidebar should allow users to navigate between folders in a natural way.
The main area should show files and folders in a grid or list view. 
The toolbar should have buttons for creating, deleting, and renaming files and folders.
I should also be able to open, close, edit the files as well as upload and download files. 
The design should be clean and modern, with a focus on usability.
