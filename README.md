**Step 4: Deploy** 🚀  
Once configured, deployment happens automatically

---

## ⚙️ Required Configuration

During deployment, you'll need to configure these **mandatory** services. Have them ready before clicking deploy:

### 🔑 1. Cloudflare API Token (Required)

Create an API token with these specific permissions:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → **My Profile** → **API Tokens**
2. Click **Create Token** → **Custom Token**
3. Add these **exact permissions**:

   **Account permissions:**
   - `Workers Scripts: Edit`
   - `Workers AI: Edit` 
   - `D1: Edit`
   - `Workers KV Storage: Edit`
   - `Workers R2 Storage: Edit`
   - `Account Settings: Read`
   - `User Details: Read`

   **Zone permissions (for all zones):**
   - `Workers Routes: Edit`

4. Set **Account Resources** to `Include: All accounts`
5. Click **Continue to Summary** → **Create Token**
6. **Save this token** - you'll need it during deployment

### 🤖 2. AI Gateway Setup (Conditional)

Cloudflare Orange Build requires an authenticated AI Gateway, but **setup is automatic if you provide the right token**:

#### Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
If you have a `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` with **Read, Edit, and Run** permissions, the deployment script will automatically create and configure the AI Gateway for you. **No manual setup required!**

#### Option B: Manual Setup (If no token provided)
Only if you **don't** have an AI Gateway token, manually create one:

1. Go to [AI Gateway Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/ai/ai-gateway)
2. Click **Create Gateway**
3. Name: `orange-build-gateway` (or your preferred name)
4. **Important**: Enable **Authenticated Gateway** 
5. Click **Create authentication token**
6. Configure token with **AI Gateway Run** permissions
7. **Save both**:
   - Gateway URL: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account-id}/{gateway-name}`
   - Authentication token

### 🔐 3. Required Variables (Required)

The "Deploy to Cloudflare" button configures two types of variables:

#### Build Variables (Available to deploy.ts script)
These are needed during deployment and must be provided as build variables:

**Essential Build Variables:**
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token (from step 1)

**AI Gateway Build Variable (Highly Recommended):**
- `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` - AI Gateway token with Read, Edit, and **Run** permissions
  - **Important**: Also add this as a Worker Secret (see below) for runtime access

#### Worker Secrets (Available to your deployed app)
These are encrypted secrets available to your running Worker:

**AI Provider API Keys (Required):**
> **⚠️ Currently Required**: The following AI provider API keys are mandatory for the platform to function. We are actively working to make these optional and easily configurable in future releases.

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key for Claude models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key for GPT models  
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key for Gemini models

> **💡 AI Gateway Wholesaling Alternative**: If you have **AI Gateway Wholesaling** enabled on your Cloudflare account, you can skip the individual provider API keys above. Instead, you'll need your AI Gateway token with proper Run permissions.

**Authentication Secrets:**
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure random string for session management
- `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` - AI Gateway token (also needed as build variable above)

**Optional OAuth Secrets:**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - GitHub OAuth client ID
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth client secret
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook authentication secret

#### Environment Variables (Set in wrangler.jsonc)
These are configured automatically in `wrangler.jsonc` and don't need manual setup:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare Account ID
- `TEMPLATES_REPOSITORY` - GitHub repository for app templates
- `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY` - AI Gateway name (default: `orange-build-gateway`)
- `MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES` - Maximum container instances (default: `2`)

> **💡 Automatic vs Manual Setup**: 
> - **With `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN`**: Deployment automatically creates and configures AI Gateway for you
> - **Without token**: You must manually create AI Gateway named `orange-build-gateway` before deployment

### 🔗 4. OAuth Setup (Optional)

For user authentication (can skip for testing):

**Google OAuth:**
1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) → Create Project
2. Enable **Google+ API** 
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Add authorized origins: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev`
5. Add redirect URI: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/api/auth/google/callback`
6. Configure these environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Your Google Client ID
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Google Client Secret

**GitHub OAuth:**
1. GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **OAuth Apps**
2. Click **New OAuth App**
3. Application name: `Cloudflare Orange Build`
4. Homepage URL: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev`
5. Authorization callback URL: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/api/auth/github/callback`
6. Configure these environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - Your GitHub Client ID
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your GitHub Client Secret

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Deploy Issues

**🚫 "Insufficient Permissions" Error**
- Ensure your API token has ALL required permissions listed above
- Check that token hasn't expired
- Verify account access is set to "Include all accounts"

**🤖 "AI Gateway Authentication Failed"**  
- Confirm AI Gateway is set to **Authenticated** mode
- Verify the authentication token has **Run** permissions
- Check that gateway URL format is correct

**🗄️ "Database Migration Failed"**
- Ensure API token has **D1 Edit** permissions
- Check that account has D1 access enabled
- Wait a few minutes and retry - D1 resources may take time to provision

**🔐 "Missing Required Variables"**
- **Build Variables**: Ensure `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is provided as a build variable
- **Worker Secrets**: Verify all required secrets are set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`
- **AI Gateway Token**: `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` should be set as BOTH build variable and worker secret
- **Environment Variables**: These are automatically loaded from wrangler.jsonc - no manual setup needed

**🤖 "AI Gateway Not Found"**
- **With AI Gateway Token**: The deployment script should automatically create the gateway. Check that your token has Read, Edit, and **Run** permissions.
- **Without AI Gateway Token**: You must manually create an AI Gateway before deployment:
  1. Go to [AI Gateway Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/ai/ai-gateway)
  2. Create gateway named `orange-build-gateway` (or your custom name)
  3. Enable authentication and create a token with **Run** permissions

**💡 "AI Gateway Wholesaling"**
- Users with AI Gateway Wholesaling can skip individual provider API keys
- Ensure your AI Gateway token has proper Run permissions for all providers

## 🏠 Local Development

Here's how to run it locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+, Cloudflare account with Workers paid plan

### Quick Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloudflare-vibecoding-starter-kit.git
cd cloudflare-vibecoding-starter-kit && bun install

cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with proper values

bun run install
bun run db:generate && bun run db:migrate:local
bun run dev

# To deploy
bun run deploy
```

### Development Commands
```bash
bun run dev              # Start development servers
bun run build            # Build for production
bun run deploy           # Deploy to Cloudflare
bun run db:generate && bun run db:migrate:local
bun run lint             # Run code quality checks
```

---

## 🗑️ Undeployment Guide

When you need to clean up or remove your Cloudflare Orange Build instance, use the automated undeployment script:

### Standard Cleanup (Recommended)
```bash
bun scripts/undeploy.ts
```
**What it does:**
- ✅ Deletes Worker and all containers
- ✅ Removes all container images
- ✅ Deletes KV namespaces and R2 buckets
- ⚪ **Preserves** D1 database (your data stays safe)
- ⚪ **Preserves** dispatch namespace (for future deployments)

### Complete Destruction (Use with Caution)
```bash
bun scripts/undeploy.ts all --force
```
**What it does:**
- ✅ Everything from standard cleanup, PLUS:
- ⚠️ **PERMANENTLY DELETES** D1 database and all data
- ⚠️ **PERMANENTLY DELETES** dispatch namespace

> **⚠️ WARNING**: The `all --force` mode will **permanently delete ALL your data**. This cannot be undone. Only use this when you're completely sure you want to destroy everything.

### Authentication Requirements

**For Container Deletion**: The script requires **API Token authentication** (not OAuth) to delete containers. If you see authentication errors:

1. **Option A**: Use API token authentication
   ```bash
   wrangler logout
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
   bun scripts/undeploy.ts
   ```

2. **Option B**: Use wrangler login with API token
   ```bash
   wrangler login  # Choose API token option when prompted
   bun scripts/undeploy.ts
   ```

### What Resources Are Deleted

| Resource Type | Standard Mode | Complete Mode (`all --force`) |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Worker | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Deleted |
| Containers | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Deleted |
| Container Images | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Deleted |
| KV Namespaces | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Deleted |
| R2 Buckets | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Deleted |
| D1 Database | ⚪ Preserved | ⚠️ **DELETED** |
| Dispatch Namespace | ⚪ Preserved | ⚠️ **DELETED** |

### Safety Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple resources are deleted simultaneously for faster cleanup
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Automatic confirmation handling prevents hanging prompts  
- **Error Resilience**: Failed deletions don't stop the entire process
- **Clear Feedback**: Detailed progress reporting and final summary
- **Safe Defaults**: Standard mode preserves critical data by default

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Binding name already in use" during redeployment:**
```bash
# After undeployment, if you see this error during next deployment:
bun scripts/undeploy.ts  # Clean up first
bun run deploy           # Then redeploy fresh
```

**"DELETE method not allowed" for containers:**
```bash
# Switch to API token authentication:
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-token"
bun scripts/undeploy.ts
```

**Resources already deleted manually:**
- The script safely handles resources that don't exist
- Check the final summary to see what was actually deleted vs. already missing

## 🔐 Complete Secrets & Variables Reference

This section provides comprehensive documentation for all configuration variables used in Cloudflare Orange Build, organized by their purpose and location.

### Environment Variables (wrangler.jsonc `vars` section)

These variables are configured in `wrangler.jsonc` and are available to your Worker at runtime. They are **not encrypted** and should only contain non-sensitive configuration.

#### Core Platform Configuration
```jsonc
"vars": {
  "TEMPLATES_REPOSITORY": "https://github.com/AshishKumar4/cloudflare-build-templates",
  "CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY": "c-coder",
  "CUSTOM_DOMAIN": "build.cloudflare.dev", 
  "MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES": "2",
  "CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_URL": ""
}
```

GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-oauth-app-secret"
```

**Webhook Security:**
```bash
WEBHOOK_SECRET="secure-random-string-for-webhook-validation"
```

### Build-Time Variables

These variables are available during deployment and should be configured as **Build Variables** in your deployment environment:

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API access for resource creation during deployment | ✅ Required |
| `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Enables automatic AI Gateway setup during deployment | 🟡 Recommended |

### Cloudflare Resource Bindings (wrangler.jsonc)

These are automatically configured by Wrangler and don't require manual setup:

#### Database & Storage Bindings
```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "DB",                          // Access via env.DB
    "database_name": "orange-build-db",
    "database_id": "auto-generated"
  }
],
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "binding": "TEMPLATES_BUCKET",           // Access via env.TEMPLATES_BUCKET  
    "bucket_name": "orange-build-templates"
  }
],
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "INSTANCE_REGISTRY",          // Access via env.INSTANCE_REGISTRY
    "id": "auto-generated"
  }
]
```

#### AI & Container Bindings
```jsonc
"ai": {
  "binding": "AI"                           // Access via env.AI
},
"containers": [
  {
    "class_name": "UserAppSandboxService",   // Access via env.UserAppSandboxService
    "image": "./SandboxDockerfile",
    "max_instances": 200
  },
  {
    "class_name": "DeployerService",         // Access via env.DeployerService
    "image": "./DeployerDockerfile", 
    "max_instances": 1
  }
]
```

#### Durable Objects & Services
```jsonc
"durable_objects": {
  "bindings": [
    {
      "class_name": "CodeGeneratorAgent",    // Access via env.CodeGenObject
      "name": "CodeGenObject"
    },
    {
      "class_name": "UserAppSandboxService", // Access via env.Sandbox
      "name": "Sandbox"
    }
  ]
},
"services": [
  {
    "binding": "RUNNER_SERVICE",            // Access via env.RUNNER_SERVICE
    "service": "runner-service"
  }
]
```

### Setting Up Your Configuration

#### For Local Development (.dev.vars)
1. Copy the example file: `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars`
2. Fill in your API keys and tokens
3. Leave optional values as `"default"` if not needed

#### For Production Deployment
1. **Build Variables**: Set in your deployment platform (GitHub Actions, etc.)
2. **Worker Secrets**: Automatically handled by deployment script or set manually:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
   # ... etc
   ```

#### Environment Variable Priority
The deployment system follows this priority order:
1. **Environment Variables** (highest priority)
2. **wrangler.jsonc vars**
3. **Default values** (lowest priority)

Example: If `MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES` is set both as an environment variable (`export MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES=5`) and in wrangler.jsonc (`"MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES": "2"`), the environment variable value (`5`) will be used.

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ **Never commit secrets** to version control
- ✅ **Use separate configurations** for development and production  
- ✅ **Rotate API keys regularly**, especially for production
- ✅ **Set minimal required permissions** for API tokens
- ✅ **Use strong random strings** for JWT_SECRET and WEBHOOK_SECRET
- ⚠️ **Store secrets in encrypted worker secrets**, not environment variables
- ⚠️ **Validate all secrets are set** before deployment
